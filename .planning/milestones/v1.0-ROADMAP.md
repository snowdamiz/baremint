# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-01
**Phases:** 1-9
**Total Plans:** 35

## Overview

Baremint delivers a crypto-native creator platform where creators launch SPL tokens on permanent bonding curves and viewers buy/burn tokens to access content. The roadmap progressed from security foundations (auth, wallets, smart contract) through creator onboarding (KYC, token launch) and content infrastructure (uploads, moderation, gating) to the complete token economy (trading, burn-to-unlock, monetization) and finally discovery and growth features.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication & Wallets

**Goal**: Users can securely create accounts and interact with a custodial Solana wallet without any crypto knowledge
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Database schema, Drizzle ORM, Better Auth email/password, split-screen auth UI, route protection
- [x] 01-02: Custodial wallet creation on signup, AES-256-GCM encryption, dashboard wallet widget with balance
- [x] 01-03: Google/Twitter OAuth, TOTP 2FA setup and enforcement, SOL withdrawal flow with address book

### Phase 2: Bonding Curve Smart Contract

- [x] 04-05: Post editing/deletion, admin moderation queue, and 3-strike system

### Phase 5: Token-Gated Content

**Goal**: Viewers holding sufficient creator tokens can access gated content; others see a locked placeholder
**Depends on**: Phase 3, Phase 4
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Schema extension (access level, threshold, token balance cache), publish API with access level params, access level step in post composer
- [x] 05-02: Token balance verification via Helius RPC with DB cache, blur variant generation (image + video), R2 presigned GET URLs, Mux signed playback tokens
- [x] 05-03: Gated content media API, locked post rendering with blur overlays, unlock dialog with balance info and placeholder buy/burn buttons

### Phase 6: Token Trading

**Goal**: Viewers can buy and sell creator tokens through the bonding curve with a full trading interface
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 5 plans

### Phase 7: Burn-to-Unlock Premium Content

**Goal**: Viewers can burn tokens to permanently unlock premium/PPV content, completing the token economy

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Schema (content_unlock), burn math, transaction builder, burn API routes, access control updates
- [x] 07-02: Unlock dialog burn flow, post composer burn_gated updates, content refresh after unlock

### Phase 8: Creator Monetization & Donations

**Goal**: Creators can view all revenue streams, claim vested tokens, withdraw earnings, and receive tips from viewers
**Depends on**: Phase 6, Phase 7
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Vesting account reader, earnings SQL aggregation, earnings dashboard page
- [x] 08-02: Claim vested tokens and withdraw trade fees (instruction builders + server actions + UI)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Permanent bonding curve (no graduation) — simpler model, prevents liquidity fragmentation
- Custodial wallets with AES-256-GCM encrypted keys — lower barrier for non-crypto users
- KYC gate via Sumsub for token launch — anti-rug + regulatory
- 30-day cliff + 60-day linear vest with weekly snapping — prevents early dumps
- Deflationary burn (no SOL return to viewer) — simpler economics
- Cloud storage (R2 + Mux) over IPFS — cost-effective, better video UX
- Soft-delete posts for legal compliance — never hard delete
- Polling-based notifications (30s) — simpler than WebSocket for MVP

**Issues Resolved:**

- Blake3 v1.5.5 pinned for SBF platform-tools compatibility (edition2024 unsupported)
- Node.js crypto for Ed25519 keypair (Web Crypto keys non-extractable)
- Dynamic imports for SSR-incompatible libs (Sumsub WebSDK, lightweight-charts, canvas-confetti)
- Two-phase video upload (R2 first for CSAM scan, then Mux for transcoding)
- BigInt throughout trading math to match on-chain Rust precision

**Issues Deferred:**

- Trade page wallet balance fetching (quick-amount buttons non-functional)
- Devnet deployment (faucet rate-limited)
- Proper admin roles system (using ADMIN_EMAILS env var for MVP)
- WebSocket/SSE notifications (using polling for MVP)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- 1 minor test failure in vesting idempotent revoke

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Notification fan-out capped at 1000 holders
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- ADMIN_EMAILS env var instead of proper roles table
- Weekly vesting snapping leaves ~6.7% of allocation permanently locked
